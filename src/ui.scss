// First we will pull in the NPM Dependency - normalize.css - to act as a cover all bases reset
@import 'normalize.css';

// Secondly, we will pull in our base configuration. This can be overridden later in your custom theme files.
@import 'foundry/config';

// Next, we will pull in all of our base project files - these include mixins and functions, used thoughout FoundryCSS

// These can be pulled in all in one

// NOTE: We may choose to abandon this approach, if we find that the submodules in this folder are intrinsic to the project
